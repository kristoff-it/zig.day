The IEEE Chapter at BCIT is hosting us! Building SW01, Room 2019. Bring $10 cash
to pitch in for sushi lunch. Please RSVP by Nov 12 so we have the numbers for
the lunch orders.

The primary goal of Zig Day is to make friends, collaborate with each other, and
hone our software (and hardware!) engineering skills. Generally, that means
working in pairs or groups to write some code and share it at the end of the
day.

Learning is the key: feel free to experiment on your own, asking around when in
doubt; or sit down with someone else and contribute to an existing Zig project.

There are no constraints for what to do during the Zig Day. If you’re looking
for inspiration, try to come up with ideas to strengthen our local community.
Volunteer organizations and nonprofits often can use all the help they can get,
including in our field of software.

For those unfamiliar with Zig, the organizer ([Matthew
Knight](https://mattnite.net)) will run a quick introduction to the language
with a focus on embedded systems before lunch. Students are then encouraged to
join other groups or start their own projects.

## RSVP

There is limited space and we need numbers for the lunch order. Please RSVP
