Vancouver is a hot bed for Zig and systems programming. The second ever
[Software You Can Love](https://softwareyoucanlove.ca) took place in this city,
and there's a strong, friendly community of developers here who like to meet.

I am [Matthew Knight](https://mattnite.net) and will be the main organizer for
the time being. 

Here is a rough itinerary of what the day should look like:

- 09:30 - 10:00: gathering and chit-chat
- 10:00 - 10:30: explain projects, form groups, setup workstations
- 10:30 - 12:30: work on stuff together
- 12:30 - 02:00: lunch break
- 02:00 - 04:00: work on stuff together (continued)
- 04:00 - 04:30: show others what you built and what you learnt
