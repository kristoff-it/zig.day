Welcome to the first Zig Day KW!

We're going to be meeting at the Kitchener Public Library (https://www.kpl.org/), at the Central Library location.
The address is 85 Queen Street North, Kitchener, ON N2H 2H1, Canada.

You can learn more about this particular branch of the KPL, including information on parking and transit options, here: https://www.kpl.org/your-library/locations-and-hours/central-library.

The library has a café inside with a small selection of drinks and pastries.
It's a 5-10 minute walk from downtown Kitchener where we'll be able to go to grab some lunch.

The rough agenda is:

- 10:00 - 10:30: gathering and chit-chat
- 10:30 - 11:00: explain projects, form groups, setup workstations
- 11:00 - 01:00: work on stuff together
- 01:00 - 02:30: lunch break
- 02:30 - 04:30: work on stuff together (continued)
- 04:30 - 05:00: show others what you built and what you learnt

No need to bring anything except yourself and your good cheer :) . And maybe a laptop, although the library does have computers available that people can use.

The event is open to anyone interested in Zig, no matter their technical capabilities or familiarity with the language!
