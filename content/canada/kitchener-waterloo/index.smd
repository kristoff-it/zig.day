This event is inspired by [Zig Day Milano](/europe/milano/) and [Zig Day Portland](/usa/portland/).

The primary goal of Zig Day KW is to make friends, collaborate with each
other, and hone our software (and hardware!) engineering skills. Generally, that
means working in pairs or groups to write some code and share it at the end of
the day.

Learning is the key: feel free to experiment on your own, asking around when in
doubt; or sit down with someone else and contribute to an existing Zig project.

There are no constraints for what to do during the Zig Day. If you're looking
for inspiration, try to come up with ideas to strengthen our local community.
Volunteer organizations and nonprofits often can use all the help they can get,
including in our field of software.

This event is open to the public.

### What to expect

Zig days in Kitchener-Waterloo are currently organized by
[Kristófer Reykjalín](https://thorlaksson.com/).

The first event has yet to be announced. Assuming there is interest, September
or October 2025 are likely candidates.

A typical Zig Day in Kitchener-Waterloo runs as follows (times are approximate):

- 10:00 - 10:30: gathering and chit-chat
- 10:30 - 11:00: explain projects, form groups, setup workstations
- 11:00 - 01:00: work on stuff together
- 01:00 - 02:30: lunch break
- 02:30 - 04:30: work on stuff together (continued)
- 04:30 - 05:00: show others what you built and what you learnt
