Looking to meet and work with Zig and SYCL enthousiast in the greater Braunschweig area? 
Look no further.

After an unforseen delay we are starting a Zig Day Braunschweig with 
the first meeting scheduled for the 8th of November 2025.

Primary goal of the Zig Day Braunschweig is
to meet up with other people interested in Zig and 
Software You Can Love (SYCL),
to build something together,
and share the experience.

This means working with others (in pairs, a group),
or on your own being able to ask for advice across
the table when necessary.
Spend the day writing some code and 
share the result and what you learnt at the end of the day. 
(But you probably already [knew that is the idea](/about))


### What to expect

We want to have a Zig Day with monthly or bi-monthly cadence.

Initially this can (and will) be hosted at Anthon's home,
where he can host 15-20 people.
The location has WiFi, power (and wired ethernet if necessary).
The downside of this location (in the far south of Braunschweig)
is that it is not directly connected to the main station by public transport,
requiring quite a bit of time to reach,
if you come by train from outside Braunschweig.

Once established we will look for a more centrally located venue,
that is more easy to reach and also when necessary to accomodate more people.

A typical Zig Day in Braunschweig would run as follows (times are approximate):

- 09:30 - 10:00: gathering and chit-chat
- 10:00 - 10:30: explain projects, form groups, setup workstations
- 10:30 - 12:30: build amazing stuff
- 12:30 - 14:00: lunch break (see next section)
- 14:00 - 16:00: build some more amazing stuff
- 16:00 - 17:00: show others what you built and what you learnt

### Attending, food & drink, allergies

Please contact Anthon, via the [email](mailto:zigday@ruamel.eu),
if you are interested in attending Zig Day Braunschweig.

Knowing how many will attend is necessary to provide and set up 
enough tables and chairs (and provide food (see below)). 

Please indicate how you will be travelling (to get instructions).
If you are coming by car,
and if you are willing to potentially pick up other attendees on the way
(from the main train station, and/or the nearby bus or tram end-points),
please indicate if so.
In that case also let know if your contact information can be provided to those other
attendees (to make sure everyone is at the same exit from the train station).
If applicable, don't hide the fact that you are interested in helping out to organize the Zig Day. 

There will be food for lunch (probably bread and/or breadrolls), so let me know if there 
are restrictions on what you will/can eat (e.g. vegan). 
There will be (carbonated) water, tea and coffee to drink. 
Bring any sugary, fizzy, drink of your choice, if you need that to function properly,
or any sweets/snacks food you cannot do without.

The main occupant of the location is Coco, a cat. Most people that are mildly allergic to cats 
have little or no problems with being in the house (she is half-bengal), but prepare as needed.
