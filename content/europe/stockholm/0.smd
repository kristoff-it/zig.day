**Welcome to the 1st Zig Day Stockholm!**

We will meet at the [Kungsholmens Internationella Biblioteket](https://biblioteket.stockholm.se/bibliotek/kungsholmens-bibliotek-internationella-biblioteket), 
at the Programrummet on the 2nd floor. 

The library is located right next to the **Fridhemsplan** metro station, 
you can take either the green line or the blue line going from T-Centralen to the northwest.

The rough agenda is:

- **10:00 ~ 10:30** : gathering and chit-chat.
- **10:30 ~ 11:00** : explain projects, form groups, setup workstations.
- **11:00 ~ 13:00** : work on stuff together.
- **13:00 ~ 14:30** : lunch break.
- **14:30 ~ 16:30** : work on stuff together (continued).
- **16:30 ~ 16:45** : share what you built and what you learnt.

To the staff's convenience we will leave 15 minutes before the library closes at 17:00.

The event is open to anyone interested in Zig or writing software you can love, 
no matter their technical capabilities or familiarity with the language!

You only need to bring a laptop and yourself :).
