Feeling isolated in cold dark Sweden? Then let's meet!

Zig Day Stockholm is structured to facilitate to enable local community — making
friends, collaborating, and  helping you practice your craft in a social and
meaningful way.

You can work on your own project, pair up with others, and talk with like-minded
individuals. The only real expectation is that you care about what you make and
other people, be them a friend, a neighbor or a stranger.

If you are beginner: don't be afraid to join. Lots of more experienced 
folks like to meet motivated beginners, some enjoy to share theirs ideas than 
they can work on and might be interested in giving you initial pointers.

It's an environment where you can build software that you deeply care about, and
meet people who also care.

This event is open to the public.


### What to build

Any [Software You Can Love](https://softwareyoucan.love/), this might come in many forms, such as:

- Improving accessibility in Linux.
- Exploring ways to make static websites more [accessible](https://kristoff.it/blog/static-site-paradox/).
- [STB-style](https://github.com/nothings/stb?tab=readme-ov-file#why-do-you-list-lines-of-code-its-a-terrible-metric) libraries, simple, hackable by a single person.
- Visualization for your university material, making it easier for the next students to learn.
- Bespoke needs of your Public Library.
- Efficient software that doesn't waste users batteries and time.
- Anything you are passionate about and you can imagine a better alternative.

Don't feel limited by the suggestions provided above, these are inspire what
kind of software is important but lack the social infrastructure to happen.

It doesn't matter if it's a hard or an easy problem — and no need to care about
"market share" — alternatives are important, and bespoke solutions are the
strength of working as a community.

When out of ideas, consider the needs of your communities, library or university
— volunteer organizations and non-profits for example could always use a hand.

Even building a small game as a gift for a friend is meaningful, or assisting
your previous professor to improve  their class with software in a way a
textbook can't.

At the end of the day, you don't have to build anything "traditionally" useful,
anything you deeply care about is useful.
