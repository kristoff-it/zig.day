### Goals for the day

The primary goal is learning and sharing knowledge!
You should be able to finish the day taking away a novel concept about Zig or systems programming.

This can be done in various ways, here is a non-exhaustive list:

* Free-form building software collaboratively
* Learning a fun and intriguing thing about Zig
* Discuss the new IO interface and recent 0.15.2 release breaking changes
* Work in pair or mob on an existing Zig project
* Explore the documentation and read the standard library source code
* Sharing what was built and learnt with the participants
* And of course https://zig.day/about/

All the attendees are encouraged to learn Zig if they are new to the language, or mentor newcomers if they are already proficient with the language.

### What to expect

A typical day might look like this:

09:30 - 10:00: gathering and chit-chat
10:00 - 10:30: explain projects, form groups, setup workstations

12:30 - 14:00: lunch break
14:00 - 16:00: build amazing stuff (continued)
16:00 - 17:00: show others what you built and what you learnt
