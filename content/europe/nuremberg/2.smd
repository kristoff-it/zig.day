## Organizers

Thanks to [codecentric AG](https://www.codecentric.de) for providing the venue and catering for this event!
We'll meet in the office of codecentric AG on the first floor of the building (ring the bell so we can let you in).

Thanks to [WeStack IT GmbH](https://westack-it.eu) for their support with the organization.

## Goals for the day

The primary goal is learning and sharing knowledge!
You should be able to finish the day taking away a novel concept about Zig or systems programming.

This can be done in various ways, here is a non-exhaustive list:

* Free-form building software collaboratively
* Learning a fun and intriguing thing about Zig
* Discuss the new IO interface and recent 0.16.0 release breaking changes
* Work in pair or mob on an existing Zig project
* Explore the documentation and read the standard library source code
* Sharing what was built and learnt with the participants
* And of course https://zig.day/about/

All the attendees are encouraged to learn Zig if they are new to the language, or mentor newcomers if they are already proficient with the language.

### Additional work areas

Based on you feedback, this time we can provide tables and screens for smaller coworking sessions.

For larger workshops, we can use the meeting room with a large monitor to share your screen.
