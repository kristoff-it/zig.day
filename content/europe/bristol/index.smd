Zig Day Bristol was started to bring together the Zig community in the UK, providing a space where
we can connect, share, and learn while honing our systems programming skills.

We follow the [Zig Day format](/about/): a full day of collaborative programming. Work on whatever
you like, join someone else, or come along for the discussions. The goal is to learn something new.
**We'll start the day at around 10:00** by introducing ourselves and what we'd like to work on.
Don't worry if you don't have a project in mind -- there will be plenty of projects to get involved
with. **We'll have a break at around 13:00 to grab lunch** at one of the many great local spots.
**Finally, we'll wrap up at around 17:00**. There's no pressure to stay all day, but we encourage
you to join for the start. After the event, we'll head somewhere for food and drinks with whoever's
up for it!

This event is beginner-friendly: if you don't know Zig, this could be a great place to get started!
You'll be surrounded by Zig users who are already familiar with the language (including one member
of the Zig core team), and you can just use the day as an opportunity to learn about other projects
if you don't know where to start. You could even come along having never done any systems
programming just to learn the basics!
