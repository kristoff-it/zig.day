Zig users in England and the UK can seem sparse, so let's change that! This Zig Day exists to bring
together the Zig community in the UK, helping up to hone our Zig and systems programming skills to
create [Software You Can Love](https://softwareyoucan.love/).

The format is the same as other Zig Day events: you can work on whatever you want throughout the
day, but collaboration and discussion is encouraged, and the main goal is to learn something new.
At the start of the event, we'll all introduce ourselves and explain what projects we're planning to
work on. Don't worry if you don't have anything to bring -- there will be enough projects around the
room that you'll definitely find something to get involved in!

This event is beginner-friendly: if you don't know Zig, this could be a great place to get started!
You'll be surrounded by Zig users who are already familiar with the language (including one member
of the Zig core team), and can just use the day as an opportunity to learn about other projects if
you don't know where to start. You could even come along having never done any systems programming
just to learn the basics!

### What to expect

The first event is expected to happen some time in September, possibly in Bristol Central Library.
We expect it to start at around 10:30 and end around 16:30 (the date is TBC) with a lunch break at
around 13:00. All of these details are subject to change, so consider subscribing to email or RSS
notifications to make sure you know when the event is organised.

We're not yet sure how often we'd like to run these events. That's going to depend largely on the
turnout at the first one, so do make sure to come along if you're interested!
