Our first Zig Day has been organised in Bristol Central Library. We have the First Floor Meeting Room from 10:00 until 17:00, and expect to start the
event proper around 10:15 with a 1 hour lunch break around 13:00.

As always, make sure to bring along a project if you can---something other people can ask questions about or help with!
