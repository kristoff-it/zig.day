[Parallel Wireless](https://www.parallelwireless.com/) have agreed to hosting another Zig Day!

We'll be in the same location as last month, with the same [agenda](/europe/bristol) as usual,
so starting at 10:00. Of course, if you need to arrive later due to transport, that's fine: someone
will still be able to let you in.

## RSVP

Like last month, if you're planning to attend, **you must [RSVP using Luma](https://lu.ma/ikypigt5)**.
On the day, someone will be by the building entrance from 10:00 to check your tickets and let you in.
If you arrive a bit later or get locked out, call 07599918784 and someone will come down to let you in.
