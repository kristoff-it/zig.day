Thanks to the [codingbunker](https://www.codingbunker.it) community for providing the venue for this event!

### Goals for the day

The primary goal is learning and sharing knowledge!
You should be able to finish the day taking away a novel concept about Zig or systems programming.

This can be done in various ways, here is a non-exhaustive list:

* Free-form building software collaboratively
* Discuss the recent 0.15.1 release breaking changes and how to implement them
* Work in pair or mob on an existing Zig project
* Explore the documentation and read the standard library source code

All the attendees are encouraged to learn Zig if they are new to the language, or mentor newcomers if they are already proficient with the language.

### RSVP
