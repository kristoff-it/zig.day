The Italian Zig community is growing and we are happy to host the first ever Zig Day!

Primary goal of the Zig Day Milano is to meet other people interested in Zig and build something together.
This means working in pair or groups to write some code and share it at the end of the day.

Learning is the key: feel free to experiment on your own, asking around when in doubt; or sit down with someone else and contribute to an existing Zig project.

There are no constraints for what to do during the Zig Day, the only rule is to note at least one thing that was learnt during the day, so it can be shared with other attendees at the end of the day.

We build software with the same love we cook food!

### What to expect

We want to have a Zig Day with monthly cadence, usually around the second weekend of the month.
It is not certain we will do it, due to the difficulty of finding venues that host on Saturday.

We don't have a stable venue to host all our events yet, so expect changes from month to month.

A typical Zig Day in Milan would run as follows (times are approximate):

- 09:30 - 10:00: gathering and chit-chat
- 10:00 - 10:30: explain projects, form groups, setup workstations
- 10:30 - 12:30: build amazing stuff
- 12:30 - 14:00: lunch break
- 14:00 - 16:00: build amazing stuff (continued)
- 16:00 - 17:00: show others what you built and what you learnt
