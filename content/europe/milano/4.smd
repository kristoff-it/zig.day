Hi, Loris here with a big announcement for this event.
Sorry for the wall of text and **don't forget to RSVP if
you plan to come**.

# Zig Day Milano in SEREGNO!

This is the first Zig event in Seregno since
the last Software You Can Love Milan conference, where
the day after the conference was dedicated to eating
good pizza and tasting **the best ice cream** in northern
Italy (and beyond!).

This Zig Day will have the same structure as any other,
but there are going to be some optional activities (mainly
geared towards eating and drinking) that you are welcome to
take part to.

## Extra activities

### Breakfast @ Napoli Bakery

The main Zig Day starts at 9:00. For those who are able
and willing to arrive to Seregno by 8:10 at the latest
(more on this in the 'Getting to Seregno' section), you
can join me at [Napoli Bakery](https://maps.app.goo.gl/PwLuW3pXqPhUa9xK7).

My recommendations:

- Coda d'aragosta (crema chantilly)
- Zeppola di san giuseppe (crema pasticcera)
- Cornetto ischitano (ripieno a piacere)

After we're done with breakfast, we'll walk to the
event location.

### Lunch @ Pane e Olio + Gelato @ Albero dei Gelati

Seregno has a few other choices, but the main group will
eat lunch at [Pane e Olio](https://maps.app.goo.gl/oWBU5XRsHffcBrb8A).

After lunch, if it's good weather and we feel like it,
we can walk to [Albero dei Gelati](https://maps.app.goo.gl/QmpGpzv34bp7joEv8)
get an ice cream, and then we walk back.

### Dinner and beyond

I haven't settled on a specific restaurant yet, but
of course we can have dinner together.

Ater dinner we can stop by [Old Station Pub](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Fdrb7kU5B8tfXTBP9)
and get a couple of beers.

One nice thing about Old Station Pub is that it's right
next to the train station so if you plan to return by
train, you can stay until around 23:00. Same applies to
parking spots (see the next section), both recommended
parking locations are right next to it.

And if you want to take it easy and sleep in Seregno,
[Biffi Hotel](https://maps.app.goo.gl/vWeidrxkiKP342gSA)
is also right next to the pub.

## Getting to Seregno

### Parking

Recommended parking locations:

- [Parcheggio Stazione](https://maps.app.goo.gl/ppiKJ4pvR2LJkoGH8) (free, outdoors)
- [Parcheggio La Torre](https://maps.app.goo.gl/zFaSis5cU7PEMxgC6) (paid, indoors)

### Trains

If you're coming from Milan:

- RegioExpress from Milano Centrale (recommended, every hour at :43, takes 25mins)
- S11 from Porta Garibaldi (every hour at :08 and :38, takes 35mins)
- S9 from Lambrate (every hour at :26 and :56, takes 35mins)

Seregno is Ring 6 so you'll need a ticket that covers rings 1-6.

If you take the 7:43 RE from Centrale, you'll be in Seregno
perfectly on time for breakfast at Napoli Bakery :^)

If you have any quesiton about logistics, feel free to ping me
(@kristoff) on the [Zig Italia](https://t.me/ziglang_it) Telegram group,
or via email (loris@zig.day).

## Main Zig Day Event

### Location

[WeDesk](https://www.wedesk.space/) has kindly offered to host us.

WeDesk is a coworking space in Seregno located close to the train
station and all the aforementioned eating and drinking places.

The main entrance is in Via Magenta and it's easy to recognize.

### Schedule

We would like to dedicate more time to coding, so we are aiming for 9:00 CET to be at the venue,
starting the programming activities at 9:30 CET.

A detailed agenda is in the RSVP link.

### Goals for the day

The primary goal is learning and sharing knowledge!
You should be able to finish the day taking away a novel concept about Zig or systems programming in general.

This can be done in various ways, here is a non-exhaustive list:

- Free-form building software collaboratively
- Discuss the upcoming 0.16.0 release breaking changes and how to implement them, especially on std.Io
- Work in pair or mob on an existing Zig project
- Explore the documentation and read the standard library source code

All the attendees are encouraged to learn Zig if they are new to the language, or mentor newcomers if they are already proficient with the language.
