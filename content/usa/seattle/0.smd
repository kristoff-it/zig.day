Zig Day is finally coming to Seattle!

Zig Day Seattle is a full day event where you can make and learn about Software You Can Love written in Zig.  The event is focused on making friends, collaborating with each other, and honing our software engineering skills. Generally, that means working in pairs or groups to write some code and sharing it at the end of the day.

Learning is the key: feel free to experiment on your own, asking around when in doubt; or sit down with someone else and contribute to an existing Zig project.

# Location

Zig Day Seattle will be in The Stadler Room of Third Place Commons.  The room can be found on the upper floor of Town Center at Lake Forest Park, next to Dumpling Generation.  To get there, there is plenty of free parking, and several adjacent bus lines.

In their own words, Third Place Commons (aka “the Commons”) is a community-supported nonprofit organization dedicated to fostering real community in real space by hosting hundreds of free events each year and presenting the Lake Forest Park Farmers Market from May to October.

There are multiple places to grab food for lunch in and near Third Place Commons.
