Zig Day Seattle is a full day event where you can make and learn about Software You Can Love written in Zig.  The event is focused on making friends, collaborating with each other, and honing our software engineering skills. Generally, that means working in pairs or groups to write some code and sharing it at the end of the day.

Learning is the key: feel free to experiment on your own, asking around when in doubt; or sit down with someone else and contribute to an existing Zig project.
