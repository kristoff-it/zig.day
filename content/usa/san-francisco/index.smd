This is a back-to-back dual event!

## Zig Day

📣 Calling all Bay Area Ziglings!

**Zig Day San Francisco** is a casual meetup for anyone who uses Zig or is just curious about it.
Come and meet people, collaborate on a project or two, and share your stuff with other Zig users.
Having a project in mind is recommended but not required.

Feel free to invite a +1, even if they are not a programmer.

## Hype o'clock

Immediately following Zig Day in the same venue is a game development-focused
meetup called **Hype o'clock Game Dev & Tea Time**. We have a very friendly
crowd made up of both regulars and newcomers.
Attendees often share their projects and work together or solo — or just come
to hang out.

Anyone attending Zig Day is welcome to stay for this event. As the name
implies, we often take a little break to have a cup of tea.

## Location

At the moment, Zig Day San Francisco is actually located in Oakland, just
across the bay, accessible by BART or car.

It takes place at a private residence, so please contact the organizer
for exact location details. The map indicates the location's neighborhood.

Email for location: **info@hypeoclock.org**

## Schedule

Note that there is a bit of overlap between the two events.

* 10:00am - 3:00pm: Zig Day
* 2:00pm - 7:00pm: Hype o'clock
