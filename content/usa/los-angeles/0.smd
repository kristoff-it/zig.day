## About:

Make friends, collaborate, and learn. Join us for the first Zig Day in LA.

## What to expect:

This is a low-stakes, warm-up zig day.
The venue is fairly small with only a single large wooden table in it for 8 people.
If there is a lot of interest (holler at me!),
I can change the reservation to a larger room at the library (to accommodate 35 people),
or switch libraries.
We hope to have a monthly zig day LA. Water will be provided and maybe some donuts.

## Schedule:

- 10:00 AM - 10:30AM - room / workstation setup / chat
- 10:30 AM - 11:00 AM - discuss projects, form groups, begin zig
- 1:00 PM - 2:00 PM - go to local restaurant for bite to eat
- 2:00 PM - 4:15 PM - continue zig
- 4:15 PM - 4:45 PM - discuss what you learned, show off
- 4:45 PM - 5::00 PM - clean up

## RSVP

## Defer Report

### Attendees

- Jeff Anderson
- Charlie Schoettle
- Logan Langdon

### Spotlights

⚡ Charlie Schoettle

Charlie made progress on a Zig library for parsing National Instruments TDMS files.
He uses National Instruments DAQs on his college rocketry team,
and he has grown frustrated with the performance of the existing python implementation.
He shared how using the `mmap()` syscall on linux can offer performance advantages by reducing I/O operations.
`mmap` maps file contents into the process' virtual address space,
relying on the kernel to only page fault parts of the file into memory that are read.
This often avoids reading the entire file off the disk when only small portions are required.
Charlie demo'd some performance measurements using [poop](https://github.com/andrewrk/poop).

⚡ Logan Langdon

Logan worked on getting Zig back as a supported / example language
for the [datastar framework](https://data-star.dev/), a tool for writing reactive web applications
with the backend of your choice (including Zig). Using [http.zig](https://github.com/karlseguin/http.zig),
Logan showed some sprites updating in his browser 
from a zig [`std.Thread`](https://ziglang.org/documentation/master/std/#std.Thread).


⚡ Jeff Anderson

Jeff learned how to use a [Raspberry Pi Debug Probe](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/microcontrollers/debug-probe.html)
to flash the [Raspberry Pi Pico](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/microcontrollers/pico-series.html) microcontroller in his [Clockwork Pi PicoCalc](https://www.clockworkpi.com/picocalc) (without pressing the button and unplugging the cables!).
Jeff also learned how to step through a zig program line-by-line in an on-chip debugger,
and print text to the uart by overriding the `logFn` for `std.log`.
Jeff demo'd using the [MicroZig](https://microzig.tech/) library to control the screen over SPI, turning it on and off.

### Cost

|Description                 |Cost (USD)|Contributed By|
|:---------------------------|---------:|-------------:|
| Venue fee                  |  `70.00` |         Jeff |
| Donuts / cleaning supplies |  `43.00` |         Jeff |
| Total                      | `113.00` |            - |

We try to keep the costs low, for a more sustainable event.
