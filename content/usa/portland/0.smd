Hello everyone, I'm pleased to announce our first Zig Day, less than one month
away. We have 40 subscribers on the mailing list and we have booked a beautiful
room in the Multinomah County Library (Central).

What to bring:
* A laptop and/or other hardware
* An idea for something to work on that is open to collaboration from others,
  or something you want to learn together.

What to expect:
* 10:00 - 10:30: gathering and chit-chat
* 10:30 - 11:00: explain projects, form groups, setup workstations
* 11:00 - 01:00: work on stuff together
* 01:00 - 02:30: lunch break
* 02:30 - 04:30: work on stuff together (continued)
* 04:30 - 05:00: show others what you built and what you learnt

In lieu of RSVPing, please make sure you are subscribed; we'll use the mailing
list count as a rough estimate of attendees.
