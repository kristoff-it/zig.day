Hello everyone, I'm pleased to announce our first Zig Day, less than one month
away. We have 40 subscribers on the mailing list and we have booked a beautiful
room in the Multnomah County Library (Central).

Community Room 1B is on the first floor. Wrap around to the left after going
through the main entrance and passing the information desk.

What to bring:
* A laptop and/or other hardware
* An idea for something to work on that is open to collaboration from others,
  or something you want to learn together.

What to expect:
* 10:00 - 10:30: gathering and chit-chat
* 10:30 - 11:00: explain projects, form groups, setup workstations
* 11:00 - 01:00: work on stuff together
* 01:00 - 02:30: lunch break
* 02:30 - 04:30: work on stuff together (continued)
* 04:30 - 05:00: show others what you built and what you learnt

In lieu of RSVPing, please make sure you are subscribed; we'll use the mailing
list count as a rough estimate of attendees.
