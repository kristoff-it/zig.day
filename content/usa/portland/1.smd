I am thrilled to announce <em>Zig Day Portland: Off By #1</em>, which will be
held the last Saturday of September the 27th. We have reserved the exact same
beautiful room in the Multnomah County Library (Central).

Community Room 1B is on the first floor. Wrap around to the left after going
through the main entrance and passing the information desk.

What to bring:
* A laptop and/or other hardware
* An idea for something to work on that is open to collaboration from others,
  or something you want to learn together.

What to expect:
* 10:00 - 10:30: gathering and chit-chat
* 10:30 - 11:00: explain projects, form groups, setup workstations
* 11:00 - 01:00: work on stuff together
* 01:00 - 02:30: lunch break
* 02:30 - 04:30: work on stuff together (continued)
* 04:30 - 05:00: show others what you built and what you learnt

In lieu of RSVPing, please make sure you are subscribed; we'll use the mailing
list count as a rough estimate of attendees.
