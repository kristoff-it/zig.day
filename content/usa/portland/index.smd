There are so many Zig users in Portland already, including the damn creator of
the language, why are we not meeting up?!

Let's start by having a Zig Day, following in the footsteps of [Zig Day
Milano](/europe/milano/).

The primary goal of Zig Day Portland is to make friends, collaborate with each
other, and hone our software (and hardware!) engineering skills. Generally, that
means working in pairs or groups to write some code and share it at the end of
the day.

Learning is the key: feel free to experiment on your own, asking around when in
doubt; or sit down with someone else and contribute to an existing Zig project.

There are no constraints for what to do during the Zig Day. If you're looking
for inspiration, try to come up with ideas to strengthen our local community.
Volunteer organizations and nonprofits often can use all the help they can get,
including in our field of software.

### What to expect

Yours truly, [Andrew Kelley](https://andrewkelley.me/), with help from
[independent game developer](https://gamesbymason.com/) and ZSF treasurer Mason
Remaley, will organize and kick off the first Zig Day.

We're thinking some time in July. After that we will be hoping to see if
someone from the community would be interested in running these events,
perhaps with a monthly cadence.

We don't have a venue or any other details yet, but, a typical Zig Day in Portland
would run as follows (times are approximate):

- 09:30 - 10:00: gathering and chit-chat
- 10:00 - 10:30: explain projects, form groups, setup workstations
- 10:30 - 12:30: work on stuff together
- 12:30 - 02:00: lunch break
- 02:00 - 04:00: work on stuff together (continued)
- 04:00 - 05:00: show others what you built and what you learnt
