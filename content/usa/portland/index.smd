We have a surprisingly high number of Zig users in Portland, including the
creator, Andrew Kelley. Let's meet up!

This event is inspired by [Zig Day Milano](/europe/milano/).

The primary goal of Zig Day Portland is to make friends, collaborate with each
other, and hone our software (and hardware!) engineering skills. Generally, that
means working in pairs or groups to write some code and share it at the end of
the day.

Learning is the key: feel free to experiment on your own, asking around when in
doubt; or sit down with someone else and contribute to an existing Zig project.

There are no constraints for what to do during the Zig Day. If you're looking
for inspiration, try to come up with ideas to strengthen our local community.
Volunteer organizations and nonprofits often can use all the help they can get,
including in our field of software.

This event is open to the public.

### What to expect

A typical Zig Day in Portland runs as follows (times are approximate):

- 10:00 - 10:30: gathering and chit-chat
- 10:30 - 11:00: explain projects, form groups, setup workstations
- 11:00 - 01:00: work on stuff together
- 01:00 - 02:30: lunch break
- 02:30 - 04:30: work on stuff together (continued)
- 04:30 - 05:00: show others what you built and what you learnt

We plan to host Zig Day Portland approximately every 2 months.
