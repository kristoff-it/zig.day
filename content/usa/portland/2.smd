I am _very sorry_ for how long this has taken, but after a long search I am thrilled
to announce we have secured a new venue for <em>Zig Day Portland #2</em>, which will
be held on Saturday, Februrary the 28th.

We received a lot of feedback that the library space we were using was too noisy,
making the whole thing kind of exhausting. We've been trying to find something different.
This time, we'll be meeting in a private room at the McMenamin's Broadway Pub! This
will give us a smaller, quieter space, and we will be able to order lunch on site.

The McMenamin's does not open until 11am, so we also needed to adjust the start time to
accomodate.

[**PLEASE RSVP ON LUMA**](https://luma.com/q5i7rd34) so that we can appropriately plan
for the number of guests.

What to bring:
* A laptop and/or other hardware
* An idea for something to work on that is open to collaboration from others,
  or something you want to learn together.

What to expect:
* 11:00 - 11:30: gathering and chit-chat
* 11:30 - 12:00: explain projects, form groups, setup workstations
* 12:00 - 05:30: work on stuff together
* 05:30 - 06:00: show others what you built and what you learnt

Since we're meeting at a restaurant that can serve us food where we're working, you will
be able to just take a break and order lunch whenever you're hungry.
